[2025-02-08 15:46:21,632][flwr][WARNING] - 
Setting `min_available_clients` lower than `min_fit_clients` or
`min_evaluate_clients` can cause the server to fail when there are too few clients
connected to the server. `min_available_clients` must be set to a value larger
than or equal to the values of `min_fit_clients` and `min_evaluate_clients`.

[2025-02-08 15:46:21,634][flwr][WARNING] - DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.simulation.start_simulation() is deprecated.
	Instead, use the `flwr run` CLI command to start a local simulation in your Flower app, as shown for example below:

		$ flwr new  # Create a new Flower app from a template

		$ flwr run  # Run the Flower app in Simulation Mode

	Using `start_simulation()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.
